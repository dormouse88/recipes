<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>Combine the flour, yeast, salt and a pinch of suger in a bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in 300ml warm water and a glug of oil. You might not need all the water so pour two thirds of it in and keep adding as needed. You want as much water as you can get in there without it becoming a sticky mess. Combine with your hand to form into a soft dough then tip out onto the worktop and knead it for 10 minutes. Anya likes doing this so she can help!<br>Form the dough in to a round and leave to rest in an oiled bowl covered with a tea towel or plastic bag until it’s doubled in size (an hour or more).</p><p>Heat some olive oil in a saucepan and fry the garlic for a minute, watching it doesn’t start to burn. Add the tinned tomatoes, a pinch of sugar and some salt and let it cook on a low heat for 30 mins or so.</p><p>When the dough is ready tip it out onto a floured surface and divide into 4 or 5 lumps.<br>Turn the oven up high, to gas mark 6 or 7.<br>Roll out a lump of dough to about 1/2cm thickness and lift on to a floured baking sheet. Spread a bit of the tomato sauce on top and cover with toppings and cheese.<br>Cook for 15 mins or until the edges are crispy.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Serve with old spring onions chopped in half (don't do that)</p></div></div>
