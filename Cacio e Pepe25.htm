The most important thing to remember for a successful cacio e pepe is not to stop mixing too soon. At first, the cheese will tend to clump together, but don't be discouraged. Keep on mixing vigorously, adding a bit of cooking water if you need to so that the pasta slithers around freely, until the cheese melts entirely and clings uniformly to the pasta. If, on the other hand, the pasta is too wet for the cheese to cling to the pasta, add more grated cheese. On the other hand, you shouldn't take too long either, as the pasta will be cooling off the whole time. If you take too long, the cheese will begin to harden and your pasta will start to get cold. So be energetic in your stirring. I find that tongs are perfect for this job, but the traditional pasta fork will do you just fine. Getting this mixing business right is a bit tricky at first, but it will come with a bit of practice.</p></div></div>
